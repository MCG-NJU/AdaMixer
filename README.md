## üì∞ News
[2022.4.4] The code is available now.

[2022.3.31] Code will be released in a few days (not too long). Pre-trained models will take some time to grant the permission of Ant Group to be available online. Please stay tuned or *watch this repo* for quick information.

## ‚ú® Highlights
### üÜï MLP-Mixer for Object Detection
To our best knowledge, we are the first to introduce the MLP-Mixer for Object detection. The MLP-Mixer is used in the DETR-like decoder in an adaptive and query-wise manner to enrich the adaptibility to varying objects across images.

### ‚ö°Ô∏è Fast Converging DETR-like Architecture
AdaMixer enjoys fast convergence speed and reach up to 45.0 AP on COCO val within 12 epochs with only the architectural design improvement. Our method is compatible with other training improvements, like [multiple predictions from a query](https://github.com/megvii-research/AnchorDETR) and [denosing training](https://github.com/FengLi-ust/DN-DETR), which are expected to improve AdaMixer further (we have not tried yet). 

### üß± Simple Architecture, NO extra attentional encoders or FPNs required
Our AdaMixer does not hunger for extra attention encoders or explicit feature pyramid networks. Instead, we improve the query decoder in DETR-like detectors to keep the architecture as simple, efficient, and strong as possible.





## ‚û°Ô∏è Guide to Our Code
Our code structure follows the MMDetection framework. To get started, please refer to mmdetection doc [get_started.md](docs/get_started.md) for installation.

Our AdaMixer config file lies in [configs/adamixer](configs/adamixer) folder. You can start training our detectors with make targets in [Makefile](Makefile).

The code of a AdaMixer decoder stage is in
[mmdet/models/roi_heads/bbox_heads/adamixer_decoder_stage.py](mmdet/models/roi_heads/bbox_heads/adamixer_decoder_stage.py).
The code of the 3D feature space sampling is in [mmdet/models/roi_heads/bbox_heads/sampling_3d_operator.py](mmdet/models/roi_heads/bbox_heads/sampling_3d_operator.py).
The code of the adaptive mixing process is in [mmdet/models/roi_heads/bbox_heads/adaptive_mixing_operator.py](mmdet/models/roi_heads/bbox_heads/adaptive_mixing_operator.py).


__NOTE:__
1. Please use `mmcv_full==1.3.3` for correct reproduction ([#4](/../../issues/4)).~~Please make sure `init_weight` methods in `AdaptiveSamplingMixing` and `AdaptiveMixing`  are called for correct initializations *AND* the initialized weights are not overrided by other methods (some MMCV versions may incur repeated initializations).~~
2. We notice ~0.3 AP (42.7 AP reported in the paper) noise for AdaMixer w/ R50 with 1x training settings.

**News**: We released the technical report on [ArXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.07155).

Documentation: https://mmdetection.readthedocs.io/

## Introduction

English | [ÁÆÄ‰Ωì‰∏≠Êñá](README_zh-CN.md)

MMDetection is an open source object detection toolbox based on PyTorch. It is
a part of the [OpenMMLab](https://openmmlab.com/) project.

The master branch works with **PyTorch 1.3+**.
The old v1.x branch works with PyTorch 1.1 to 1.4, but v2.0 is strongly recommended for faster speed, higher performance, better design and more friendly usage.

### Major features

- **Modular Design**

  We decompose the detection framework into different components and one can easily construct a customized object detection framework by combining different modules.

- **Support of multiple frameworks out of box**

  The toolbox directly supports popular and contemporary detection frameworks, *e.g.* Faster RCNN, Mask RCNN, RetinaNet, etc.

- **High efficiency**

  All basic bbox and mask operations run on GPUs. The training speed is faster than or comparable to other codebases, including [Detectron2](https://github.com/facebookresearch/detectron2), [maskrcnn-benchmark](https://github.com/facebookresearch/maskrcnn-benchmark) and [SimpleDet](https://github.com/TuSimple/simpledet).

- **State of the art**

  The toolbox stems from the codebase developed by the *MMDet* team, who won [COCO Detection Challenge](http://cocodataset.org/#detection-leaderboard) in 2018, and we keep pushing it forward.

Apart from MMDetection, we also released a library [mmcv](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmcv) for computer vision research, which is heavily depended on by this toolbox.

## License

The mmdetection project is released under the [Apache 2.0 license](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection/blob/master/LICENSE).

## Changelog

v2.12.0 was released in 01/05/2021.
Please refer to [changelog.md](docs/changelog.md) for details and release history.
A comparison between v1.x and v2.0 codebases can be found in [compatibility.md](docs/compatibility.md).
